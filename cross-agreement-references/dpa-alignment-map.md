## 3. DPA ↔ PRIVACY POLICIES

### Relationship

Privacy Policies are Controller-facing documents that inform Data Subjects about Processing. The DPA is a Processor agreement that governs how the Company Processes Personal Data on behalf of the Client.

### Alignment Requirements

- **Data protection laws:** Privacy Policies must reference same laws as DPA Section 1.1(a)
- **Security Incident notification:** Privacy Policies must align with DPA Section 7
- **Data Subject rights:** Privacy Policies must describe rights supported by DPA Section 9
- **Data retention:** Privacy Policies must align with DPA Section 13
- **International transfers:** Privacy Policies must describe transfer mechanisms in DPA Section 10

## 4. DPA ↔ OTHER AGREEMENTS

### Minimal Direct Connection

The DPA primarily supports the MSA and has limited direct connection to:

- Acceptable Use Policy
- EULA
- B2C Terms of Service
- Website Terms of Use
- Cookie Policies

However, all agreements should comply with the same Applicable Data Protection Laws listed in DPA Section 1.1(a).
