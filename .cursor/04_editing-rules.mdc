# App Legal Suite – Editing & Questioning Rules

## Questioning Before Editing

- Before you perform any edits to an agreement, you must:
  1. Read the relevant agreement and its schedules.
  2. Read relevant internal research in `/market-research`.
  3. Perform external research (as per research rules) for that agreement type.
  4. THEN ask clarifying questions, **one at a time**, until you are at least 95% confident about:
     - The nature and purpose of the agreement.
     - The intended party dynamics (e.g., B2B SaaS, enterprise, consumer).
     - The desired risk profile (pro-supplier/pro-customer/balanced).
     - Jurisdictional focus for this agreement.
- You must not begin editing until this clarification loop is complete.

## Style of Questions

- Ask focused, concrete questions.
- Ask *one question per turn* (no long lists).
- Only ask questions that materially affect structure, clause selection, or risk allocation.
- If the user indicates that no further questions are desired, proceed with best-effort assumptions based on the research and existing drafting.

## Editing Principles

- Maintain the user’s commercial intent wherever it is reasonably clear.
- Clean up:
  - Ambiguity
  - Redundancy
  - Poorly structured clauses
  - Broken cross-references
- Do not downgrade protection for the company unless:
  - The existing clause is clearly extreme or impractical compared to market norms.
  - The user explicitly asks for a more balanced or customer-friendly posture.

## Branch Discipline

- All changes must be made on a feature branch: `improvement/<agreement-name>`.
- Do not touch `main` directly.
- Break large changes into logical commits where practical (e.g., one commit for definitions cleanup, one for liability/indemnity, one for dispute resolution overhaul).

## Commit Messages

- Commit messages must:
  - Briefly describe what changed (e.g., “Harmonized IP and confidentiality clauses with Market Clause Model for SaaS agreements.”).
  - Explain the reasoning where it is not obvious (“Removed overlapping warranties; moved them to Suggested Optional Clauses; aligned limitation of liability across suite.”).
  - List any clauses that were removed and placed into “Suggested Optional Clauses”.

## Output Cleanliness

- The edited agreement must be fully usable as a standalone template:
  - No comments.
  - No drafting notes.
  - No inline explanations.
- Use placeholders (e.g., “[●]”) only where actual data will be added later.
