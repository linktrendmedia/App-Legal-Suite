# App Legal Suite – Consistency & Harmonization Rules

## Cross-Agreement Consistency

- Aim for consistent treatment across all agreements of:
  - Intellectual Property
  - Confidentiality
  - Data Protection
  - Limitation of Liability
  - Indemnities
  - Term and Termination
  - Dispute Resolution
  - Governing Law
- Where multiple agreements cover the same concept, align:
  - The definition used
  - The structure and core terms
  - Key thresholds (e.g., caps, survival periods), unless there is a clear reason to diverge.

## Definitions

- Each agreement must have a Definitions/Interpretation section.
- If the same concept (e.g., “Affiliate”, “Confidential Information”, “Control”, “Intellectual Property Rights”, “Business Day”) appears across different agreements, strive to:
  - Use the same wording or a clearly compatible wording across all agreements.
- If you need to modify a commonly used definition to better reflect market practice or jurisdiction:
  - Use the more complete / market-standard wording.
  - Adjust other agreements that use the same concept to match, unless the agreement type logically requires distinct wording.

## Schedules

- Some agreements have schedules that are meant to hold app-specific details at implementation time.
- At the template stage:
  - Keep schedule references intact (e.g., “as set out in Schedule 1”).
  - Ensure each schedule reference is clear and coherent.
  - Do NOT fill in app-specific content; keep schedules as structured blank templates/placeholders.
- Agreements and their schedules should be logically consistent (no broken references, missing schedule titles, or misnumbered schedules).

## Clause Conflicts

- If two clauses (or two templates) present conflicting treatments of the same topic (e.g., IP ownership):
  - Prefer the more complete and market-standard formulation, based on research and your clause library.
  - Adjust other agreements to match this improved clause, unless the nature of a particular agreement type reasonably requires divergence (e.g., a pure licensing agreement vs. a development agreement).

## Clause Presence Across Agreements

- Do NOT add every clause to every agreement.
- Only add or propagate a clause where:
  - The nature of the agreement and market practice justify its presence.
  - It materially protects the company without creating unnecessary friction.
- Use internal Market Clause Models (per agreement type) to decide which clauses are:
  - Mandatory
  - Recommended
  - Optional
  - Generally unnecessary

## Removed Clauses

- If you determine that a clause in an agreement is unnecessary for that agreement type:
  - Remove it from the agreement text.
  - Add it under a “Suggested Optional Clauses” section in the relevant commit message or PR description, so the user can reintroduce it if desired.
