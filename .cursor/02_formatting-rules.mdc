# App Legal Suite – Formatting & Style Rules

## Typography

- Font: Arial
- Base font size: 11 pt

## Headings

- Use **Title Case** for all headings (e.g., “Intellectual Property Rights”, “Limitation of Liability”).
- Headings should be bold or clearly distinguishable as headings in the document structure.

## Numbering

- Primary scheme:
  - Level 1: `1`, `2`, `3`, ...
  - Level 2: `1.1`, `1.2`, `1.3`, ...
  - Level 3: `1.1.1`, `1.1.2`, `1.1.3`, ...
- Prefer numbered or lettered subclauses instead of bullet symbols.
- Avoid generic bullets like “•” or “-” where possible; use numbering consistent with the above scheme.

## Spacing and Layout

- Single line spacing.
- Leave a clear line break between major clauses/sections when appropriate for readability.
- No requirement for automatic Tables of Contents or specific pagination wording (“Page X of Y” is not required).
- Avoid inserting page headers/footers unless the user explicitly requests them.

## Defined Terms

- Defined terms should be **Capitalized** (not ALL CAPS) in the running text, unless an agreement’s internal style clearly calls for ALL CAPS in a specific context (e.g., “Force Majeure Event” is acceptable; “FORCE MAJEURE EVENT” is not required).
- Each agreement must contain its own Definitions section, but definitions should be harmonized across agreements where the underlying concept is the same.

## Clean Output

- The final contract text must not contain:
  - Drafting notes
  - Bracketed explanatory comments (e.g., “[Note: consider adding X]”)
  - Internal commentary
- Only use square brackets where they are part of a template placeholder (e.g., “[● Insert Date]”, “[Supplier]”, “[Customer]”).
