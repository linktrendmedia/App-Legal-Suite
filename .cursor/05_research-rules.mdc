# App Legal Suite – Research & Market Model Rules

## Research Hierarchy

When performing external research for comparable agreements, use this priority order:

1. SEC/EDGAR filings for similar agreement types.
2. Top-tier technology / corporate law firms (e.g., well-known US/UK firms with SaaS / tech templates or publications).
3. Recognized SaaS / tech contract templates from reputable publishers.
4. Academic or doctrinal sources where directly relevant.
5. General open web results (lowest priority; treat with caution).

## Internal Research Sources

- Treat all documents in `/market-research` as internal research sources, including:
  - Template General Agreement
  - Commission Agreement
  - Convertible Loan Agreement
  - Executive Agreement
  - Shareholders’ Agreement
  - Software Development / Hosting / Licensing / Maintenance templates
  - SPA Template
- These are **high-quality references**, but NOT binding standards:
  - You may adopt or adapt their clauses if they are strong and market-aligned.
  - You are free to override them based on better external precedents or suite-level consistency.

## Market Clause Model

- For each major agreement type in `/agreements`, build or refine a **Market Clause Model** that covers:
  - Mandatory clauses.
  - Common optional/protective clauses.
  - Clauses that are rare or aggressive.
- Store structured representations (e.g., headings, summaries, notes) in:
  - `/clause-library`
  - `/cross-agreement-references` (where appropriate)

## Clause Necessity Decisions

- Use the Market Clause Model to decide for each agreement:
  - Which clauses are mandatory.
  - Which clauses are recommended.
  - Which clauses are optional.
  - Which clauses are generally unnecessary.
- Remove unnecessary clauses from the agreement text and record them as “Suggested Optional Clauses” in the commit message, not in the document.

## Jurisdiction & Compliance

- Default governing law and jurisdiction baseline is US (Nevada/Wyoming) for commercial and corporate agreements.
- Where the agreement’s **subject matter** requires it (e.g., privacy/data processing, cross-border data transfers):
  - Incorporate essential GDPR/UK GDPR compliance concepts and language as appropriate.
- Do not automatically insert EU/UK consumer law provisions into every agreement:
  - Only do so when the nature of the agreement (e.g., direct B2C consumer terms applicable to EU/UK residents) makes it necessary or strongly advisable.

## Role of the Template Suite

- Always remember: these are **template agreements** for a starter kit used repeatedly across many apps.
- Your research and drafting should:
  - Keep the templates as general and reusable as possible.
  - Allow app-specific customization to be handled later in schedules and placeholders.
  - Avoid embedding project-specific facts or commercial terms.
