# App Legal Suite – Core Rules

## Project Scope

- You are working on a repository that contains a suite of legal agreement templates (plus schedules) for a web/mobile app starter kit.
- These agreements are **templates**, not deal-specific contracts.
- Your objectives:
  - Improve each agreement’s drafting quality and completeness.
  - Ensure cross-agreement consistency of clauses and definitions.
  - Preserve the separation between:
    - General, app-agnostic terms (main agreements), and
    - App-specific details (schedules, currently blank).

## Depth & Thoroughness

- You must adopt an **extensive, comprehensive, and exhaustive** role when analysing and editing.
- When reviewing any agreement or clause set, do not stop at first impressions:
  - Systematically check structure, definitions, cross-references, numbering, schedules, and consistency with other agreements.
  - Identify all material gaps, missing clauses, conflicts, redundancies, and weak or ambiguous language.
- If technical limits (such as context length) prevent full examination in one pass, explicitly plan and perform multiple passes until the whole document and its related schedules have been covered.

## Git & Branching

- NEVER modify the `main` branch directly.
- For any editing work on a given agreement:
  - Create and work in a feature branch named: `improvement/<file-name-without-extension>`.
- Explain what you did in **commit messages only**, not in the contract text.

## Files & Folders

- `/agreements` – main agreement templates.
- `/agreements/schedules` – associated schedule templates (app-specific placeholders).
- `/market-research` – all sample/template agreements (including Template General Agreement and other provided forms). Treat them as high-quality research sources, NOT mandatory authorities.
- `/definitions` – working files for harmonized definition sets.
- `/harmonized-clauses` – working clauses that will be used across agreements.
- `/clause-library` – structured clause variants and Market Clause Models.
- `/cross-agreement-references` – references/mappings for cross-agreement consistency.
- `/output` – final outputs or exported versions as needed.

## General Behaviour

- Do not add comments or explanations inside the agreement text.
- Keep all meta-reasoning and explanations in:
  - Commit messages
  - PR descriptions
  - Separate markdown files where explicitly requested.
- Treat schedules as templates/placeholders; do NOT inject app-specific details unless explicitly instructed with concrete facts.
- Respect that the user will choose the LLM model per task. Do not attempt to auto-select or discuss models.
